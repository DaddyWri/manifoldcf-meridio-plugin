This project contains an installer intended to be installed on a Meridio server, in support of the Apache ManifoldCF Meridio connector, and a corresponding test harness.  The installer is Apache-licensed, and was granted by its original owner MetaCarta, Inc., but cannot remain within Apache because the source code is missing.  It is nevertheless required for use of the Meridio connector.
